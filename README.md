# Vite React Project with GitHub Actions Deployment

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my awesome Vite-powered React project with GitHub Actions for automated deployment. ðŸš€

## Purpose

I created this project to show off some cool stuff:

- **Vite React Project**: I've set up a super fast and efficient React project using Vite. It's like magic! ðŸª„

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Thanks to GitHub Actions, my project now deploys itself whenever I push changes to the `main` branch. No more manual deployments! ðŸ¤–

- **Continuous Deployment**: It's all about staying fresh! With this workflow, my app is always up-to-date with the latest changes. ðŸ”„

## Live Demo

2. **Install Dependencies**: Get the party started by running `npm install` or `yarn` in the project directory. ðŸŽ‰

3. **Development**: It's showtime! Use `npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to unleash the development server and work your magic on the app. ðŸŽ­

4. **Deployment**: When you're ready to share your masterpiece with the world, just push your changes to the `main` branch. GitHub Actions will handle the rest. Your app will be live and ready to dazzle! ðŸŒŸ
